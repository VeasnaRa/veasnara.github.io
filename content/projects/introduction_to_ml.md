## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions **without being explicitly programmed**. Instead of hard-coding rules, ML systems improve their performance through experience.

## Why Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is widely used because it can:
- Handle large and complex datasets
- Discover hidden patterns and relationships
- Adapt to new data over time
- Automate decision-making processes

## Core Idea
At its core, machine learning is about finding a function  
\[
f: X \rightarrow Y
\]
that maps input data \(X\) to outputs \(Y\) by minimizing an error or loss, using data-driven optimization.

## Main Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning** – learning from labeled data (e.g., regression, classification)
- **Unsupervised Learning** – discovering structure in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- **Reinforcement Learning** – learning through interaction and reward signals

## Applications
Machine learning powers many real-world systems such as:
- Image and speech recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
- Financial forecasting

## Summary
Machine learning combines **data**, **models**, and **optimization** to build systems that learn from experience and improve automatically, making it a fundamental technology in modern science and industry.
